                        In most instances of city or commute driving, Tesla vehicles have no problem <br>
                        maintaining their battery life. Capable of being charged at home overnight, there <br>

                        With electric vehicles, charging your car at home or a fast charger is an incredibly <br>
                        affordable way to keep your car running. Costing an average of  <br>
                        $15 USD (roughly 4.5 cents per mile) to fully charge a drained battery using home electricity, <br>
                        there has never been a cheaper option for refuelling your vehicle.

                        During the early days of electric vehicles, access to charging stations was a strong deterrent <br>
                        in people committing to the switch. Now, with electric vehicles picking up <br>
                        in popularity, the expansive Tesla charging network has grown to be <br>
                        incredibly expansive. Covering a large majority of area, Tesla is quickly becoming <br>
